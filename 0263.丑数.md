An **ugly number** is a *positive* integer which does not have a prime factor other than 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` *if* `n` *is an **ugly number***.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
```

**Constraints:**

- `-231 <= n <= 231 - 1`

## 解法一：

```python
class Solution:
    def isUgly(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n <= 0:
            return False
        while n % 3 == 0:
            n //= 3
        while n % 5 == 0:
            n //= 5
        return n & (n - 1) == 0
```
